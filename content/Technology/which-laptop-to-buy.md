## My Laptop already got slow, which one should I buy next?

As one of my most recent guru says, "Computers are good at repetitions". Humans might require all the time in the world to add a billion integers together and give the sum and that's where computers came into picture, originally. But, those repetitions themselves paved way for the implementation of the concepts like Servers, Automation and AI (the most recent repetition utilization technology).

But, to be able to implement those technologies I need a computer that has the capacity / configuration of a server if not a super computer, because, my computer has already got about half a decade old and runs at the speed of a computer of the previous century. I think I have to buy a new one, though assuming I have a budget for a MacBook Pro, I'm not sure of how long would that support me? Cuz, me experiencing the sluggishness of my laptop started with my 2012 edition MacBook Pro itself. I started experiencing the lags in application startups since 2017 itself. I genuinely thought, it served me well for 5 years, maybe its time for it's retirement. I had a relatively new Dell laptop with Os upgraded to Windows 10 (when Microsoft rolled out free upgrade for all users of Windows 7 or newer). I felt it to be comparatively faster to my relatively older MacBook Pro, but still I wasn't happy with the boot-up times or the application startup times but I thought I had no choice, at least for sometime. Until, I but a beast of a machine.

It was around then that I met my new manager and his age old laptop (could be from the 18th century... a couple of years more and it could find a place for itself in the nearest museum) at work and I wondered and asked him "how are you still managing with your laptop, how old is it? what are the boot up times with Windows 10 on it? what is it's configuration?". Trust me the answers to all those questions were utterly depressing but looking at my pityful expression for him, he said this finally, "I manage my windows services on it!". Now, that hit my mind hard and got stuck in it, even to date.

All this was in 2017 Jan and I'm still using the same computer, even now, in the 2nd half of 2019. My laptop now has a bootup time of about 25 seconds and shutdown time of 7 seconds. Which means, If I have a taks that takes about half a minute, I could turn my laptop on, get the task done and shut it down in under a minute, literally. Lately, I realised this once again when I tried to setup a rasa project in my laptop and work on i, cuz I did the same even in my work computer and it is a nightmare though it is a relatively newer machine.
