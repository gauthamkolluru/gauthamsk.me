## Why am I Penning this down? Or maybe 'Key'-ing this down ??

It's been long since I had a longing for writing something down, even by my own standards, about around 2 months. It definitely hasn't been because of running out of topics, infact I have about 3-4 articles left incomplete and about half-a-dozen in the pipeline that I haven't started yet. I haven't had the mood of writing something down during this while. Until now I attributed that to the changes taking place in my life but now I ain't sure. And just a while ago, a thought struck me that, It is since then when I started using my Organisation laptop that this had been happening... 

Therefore, here I come, with this article with the aforementioned thought, sharing purely __my opinions__ on the Operating Systems and their versions that I have worked with.

## Purpose

This article is an attempt to constructively critise the different operating systems that I have used by far & going to primarily reflect _my opinions and experiences_ with them. I also expect that the _naive/ameture/beginner_ programmers among you who are planning to buy a new computer or to switch to a new OS and feels like they have a similar taste like me, should be benefitted.

_Also, I would like to specially mention once again that the comments that I make on an OS are just my opinions and is not intended to defame or abase a Person, Team, Product or an Organisation._

### Windows

The first time I touched a computer goes way back in history for about more than 2 decades when I was studying my 5th grade and I was introduced to programming on on BASIC language then. The computers in lab of the school were powered by __Windows 95__. Forget about _Linux_, _Mac_ or others, I barely knew the term 'Operating Systems' and that Windows 95 was an operating system. For all I knew, it was just a __Windows Computer__, whatever that meant.

* Things I used Windows 95 for
    - BASIC (both Noun & adjective, in this context) Programming
    - Playing [_Sky Roads_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJjSRyE6PzQ) (click on the link to check how the game looks like)
    - Dealing with the _all mighty & legandary_ __Blue Screen Errors__
        - took quiet a while to understand that they are what called RAM errors

Since then, as the years passed by, I had been experiencing differnt versions of Windows like 98, 2000<sup>NT</sup>, XP, 7 and now using __Windows 10__ and __Windows XP__ being the one that I used for the longest time.

However, none of the versions until __Windows 7__ were able to fight the _Darth Vader_ of Microsoft, the __Blue Screen Errors__[^note1].

### Mac OS

I have used all versions of Mac OS from _Snow Leapord_ till _High Sierra_. My experience with Mac OS though includes a significant learning curve, had been a breeze ever since. And the eco-system that it provided along with iPhone and iPad that I had, it was kind of a cake walk while switching between devices with _Apple Continuity_ feature. Also, I must say that it was _literally_ an investment as it paid for itself later on and practically transitioned from a liability to an asset as I got some gigs as a part-time video editor that I did just with the built-in software, _iMovie_. I still feel that it was the _best match made in heaven_ ever between the hardware and software. That machine hosted the best displays that I had ever seen on any computer by far and it doesn't stop just there, the _speed_, the _reliability_ (the RAM errors on Windows was already a history), the speaker setup and what not. And all of it contributed in delivering the best experience of a laptop that I ever had. Period.

I just wrote a max of a couple of lines of code on the machine though. I gave up the machine soon I joined an organisation which requires me working on Microsoft SQL Server and I wasn't able to figure-out how to install it in my computer. Yes, I was that naive (or maybe the right word should be *stupid*) back then.

### Linux

In January 2018, I forced myself to use Linuxmint with Cinnamon flavor despite having an Activated version of Windows 10 installed on my machine for the reasons that

* with _Windows 10_
    - I observed a lot of lagging while invoking & using applications like
        - Pycharm (Python IDE from IntelliJ)
        - Chrome browser
    - My RAM and Disk utilisations were maxed out, though
    - the CPU utilisation never went up beyond 10-15%

* with _Linux_
    - Undeniably the greatest advantage is it (rather most of its versions and flavors) being distributed for absolutely no cost (apart from some versions like RedHat)
        - with all those different versions and flavors available, one has the widest range of options to choose from
    - Virus Free when compared to Windows OS, and finally
    - The fact that it comes with the captions like _"May the Source be with You"_ (Open Source), got be a little excited. Though it might be something that I maybe able to do but only in the future.

(apart from the above mentioned) I was pretty skeptical about everything regarding my machine when I moved to Linux. I knew nothing about it but just that it is the favourite operating systems of Computer Geeks, Serious Developers and the mighty Hackers. But then, I wanted to give it a try and let me tell you

* Linux is the platform that has the steepest learning curve among the OSs I've used by far (or atleast I felt so)
    - and why wouldn't it be, with all the different flavors and versions of it being available (after all, choosing the version and the flavor itself took a good 2-3 months of analysis)
* Nothing was a cake walk initially, not even adding an application to the system path just to be able to invoke it from the terminal

Yet the OS managed to keep me captivated by the immeidately improved boot up speeds and when checked under system moniter application, 

* Disk Utilisation fell drastically down 50 - 60%
* RAM utilisation to 70 - 80 %, and the best part, 
* CPU utilisations raised upto 60 - 70 % with using all the 4 cores of my 4th Gen core i5 Intel Processor.

And these statistics, led me to learn more on being able to use the OS in better ways and started looking out for blogs for my needs when I stumbled upon 1000s of them that have a rich content addressing the issues that I was looking out for apart from the _outstanding Community Support_.

Then is when I started transitioning as a full-fledged software developer. I started learning and implementing every technology that my organisation threw at me. I learnt both about and the technologies like ColdFusion, JavaScript, SQL Server Reporting Services, Tableau with them and it was then that I started looking for blogs on computer science and trying different tools that can be used for development like __Visual Studio Code__, __Sublime Text__, __ATOM__, __Brackets__, __Pycharm__ etc... 

## Applications I run in My Computer

I'm someone who prefers being able to _"Do More With Less"_. When I learnt from my mentor that he used to use Terminal (on Linux) itself to even check his emails, I got excited. When I kbserved him taking notes in the terminal, it got me excited even more. Then I learnt that the command line of Linux is named as Terminal for a reason.

Now, even I use ViM on my Terminal but only for quick/short code debugs or edits and consider myself a novice at ViM.

Below are the list of applications that I often use on my machine.

* __Browsers__ : This takes care of my entertainment as well (YouTube, PrimeVideo, Netflix)
    - Vivaldi : My favourite browser since the last couple of months as it has got some _decent, unique and (actually) useful_ features apart from speed that I like to have in a browser
        - You could download it from here if you would like to try : [Download](https://vivaldi.com/download/)
        - One downside of this browser is that one cannot watch the videos from Primevideo of Amazon on this browser in High Definition (HD)
    - Mozilla Firefox
    - Google Chrome
        - I prefer it the least among the ones mentioned here because, it kind of acts as if it is an operating system itself by acquiring insane amounts of RAM
        - I, obviously, prefer it more than the ones that I haven't mentioned here because of its versatility, cosmetics and for one main reason that I wasn't able to use both Firefox or Vivaldi with Selenium, yet.

* __Editors__
    - Visual Studio Code A.K.A. VSCode : My most favourite Code Editor by far
        - Handsdown to it's variety of features, extensions, simplicity & last but never the least 'Dark Mode'
    - ViM (on Terminal based OSs like Linux)
    - Anaconda
        - Jupyter
        - IPython

* __Integrated Development Environments (IDE)__
    - Pycharm
        - In cases where I had to manage a project or maybe just for change

## Things I hate about each

### Windows

I almost hate everyting about this operating system but the most important ones being, 

* Why the hell the alias `ls` was created in _Powershell_ if not to deceive the users when it doesn't work with any of the flags like it does in a Unix based system

* Command Prompt : a poor man's terminal where one can do nothing but run some commands and as if that's not enough, one can't even switch to `administrator` mode while using the regular one

* Why one _Powershell_ and one _Command Prompt_ when neither could beat the experience given by just one _Terminal_? 
    - I'm yet to try Terminal on windows though, which I feel is Microsoft's answer for users like me and I'm also like the fact that it is being developed as an open source software

* Application Installation / Uninstallation
    - Again in this front, nothing can beat the experience of command based installations on the Unix based systems
    - Most of you might feel the GUI based installation is quiet simple but I'm lazy to even use my touchpad/mouse to select the radio/check boxes and click the buttons as
        - I prefer command based installation to the above and the fact that one can pass the flag `-y` to auto accept all terms and conditions is just _orgasmic_!

* Windows Updates and the duration it takes

Though the buck doesn't just stop here, we have to as the list might actually get never-ending.

### MacOS

The thing that I hated the most when I used a Mac machine was the way of installing an application.

* For some, one's got to drag the application icon and drop it in the `applications` folder
* For some, double click on the icon
* For others, install from the AppStore

### Linux

I do not have anything that I can claim that I hate about it or maybe I haven't become that pro user of linux to have experienced one.

## Conclusion

After all this analysis and the fact that I actually feel that _Linux_ is the OS that made me read more, write more and code more with it, be it at just writing code itself, I would prefer Linux any day as my daily driver or goto operating system. For this, all I would do, is go and buy a machine my required size and shape and install Linux in it. And, if my pocket allows, I would buy a _MacBook Air_ or _MacBook Pro 13"_ to consume or create any audio/visual content, including writing articles for my blog/YouTube Channel.

I somehow feel _Windows_ doesn't seem like a system for professionals and therefore would recommend to prefer it for those machines that will be consumed by the non-technical folks around you as it is the system that has the least learning curve and it is again an undeniable fact that most of the computers on the planet are running on Microsoft's Windows, so, they're good even when they have to use a machine at airport lounges or so.

I'm currently at the stage of buying a new computer for my personal use and 'key'-ing this down has helped me in analysing a couple more aspects thereby narrowing down my search further. Therefore I would update it here as & when I buy any new machines in the future.
