Ever since I have bought my first desktop computer (an assembled one) back in 2005, just like most others even I got *Microsoft's* **Windows** operating system installed in it and the version was **XP**.I have bought 5 laptops since then among which 60% of them were powered by Windows Operating Systems the remaining were powered by macOS. Be it any OS I have hardly felt the operating system to be really convenient to use. I agree that I haven't explored much on them but was just using the system through the GUI provided. Though I hail from a Computer Science and Engineering background, I have recently decided not to use mouse/touchpad and try doing most of my regular activities such as creating/renaming/moving/deleting files and folders, switching between applications or between tabs in the same application, executing my scripts, installing/opening a program and so on through the command prompt itself. Soon, I have started playing with my system path and creating aliases for the programs (ex: for py2 for Python2 and py for Python3) and even creating my own key combinations using [Auto Hot Key](https://www.autohotkey.com/). I have started liking the Windows 10 Operating System lately for its stability upto some extent but my convenience of using it to the most extent. 

Irrespective of the convenience and stability, I always wanted to have my pc respond quickly for whatever task I give to it and to achieve the same, I read some blogs and disable some services like the *Windows Search, Print Spooler, Indexing, etc...*. Despite all the measures taken, my pc used consume hours together to open Pycharm or SSMS and started freezing when I installed Eclipse IDE in it. 

For this reason, my plans of experiencing the **Linux** Operating System have come forward and on 25th December 2018, I have completely wiped my pc clean and installed linux ([Click Here to know what happened when I tried sideloading linux on Windows 10](https://gauthamsk.me/technology/underconst/)).
