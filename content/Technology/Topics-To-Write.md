Topics I would like to cover in my next articles:

- Implementing the Linear Regression without Gradient Descent technique

- Theoritical explanation for the behaviour pattern of the Human Brain and how it deciphers, acknowledges and reciprocates  Emotion and Feelings

- Theoritical explanation for the hypothesis "Brains that are subjeected to exactly same environment would respond to similar situations very similarly in the future."
