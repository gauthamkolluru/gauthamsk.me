*<center>A bend in the road is never an end,
One can always and has to take a turn (be it even a re'turn')</center>*

<b style="font-size:24px;">Riding</b>... has always been a passion and it was just the delay in buying a bike that refrained me from going for long rides. Soon I bought one, I just took off. My first ride had been from [Home to a highway Cafe Coffee Day (CCD)](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/RTC+Complex,+RTC+Complex+Inner+Road,+Dwaraka+Nagar,+Visakhapatnam,+Andhra+Pradesh/Cafe+Coffee+Day,+NH16,+Tuni,+Andhra+Pradesh+533401/@17.5229174,82.6123901,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x3a39433c541aef3d:0x16e63981974e6b09!2m2!1d83.307062!2d17.7240662!1m5!1m1!1s0x3a39c8b17f9d6223:0x4c970d2110cd9711!2m2!1d82.4810714!2d17.3236798). One way distance was about 115 kms and the travel time was of approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes. I chose to ride only until there to know if I could do it at least till there as it was my first time and my parents shouldn't know about it (implying I shouldn't be late, cuz they'll be worried). I was rolling on the highway in the excitement of "finally... I'm riding". In no time (as I felt) I reached the CCD outlet. I was wondering what to do apart from having the already ordered coffee of my choice (*Cappuccino with double-shot espresso also called as King Cappuccino in some outlets*). I realised that the happiness that I was experiencing while riding disappeared. I was not quiet sure of why? Starting immediately after gulping the last sip of my coffee, riding my way back, I was happy again as I was on my rolling wheels but this time not as much as I was on my onward ride as my mind was preoccupied with the thought that why wasn't I happy in there?

I wasn't able to figure out and thought should change the topic in my mind and looked at the speed console and I realised I was cruising (on my Cruiser) at 100 kmph and was feeling excited about riding all along at the such speeds until I reach a town and all of a sudden I brought the bike to stop as the Odometer read 999. I was about complete the first 1000 kms run on my machine.

I have ridden 10s of times since then and everytime I felt same after reaching the destination. I understood that I wasn't liking reaching the destination (doesn't necessarily mean I would like not reaching it at all as well). It felt like something has ended. Sure, the (onward) journey did and that was concerning. I was exploring that feeling on my return ride and understood that it felt like once I reached the destination I have nothing to do anymore (at least for sometime), like I cannot feel the happiness that I used to, while riding. I was exploring the feeling and the possible / probable reasons triggering, more and deeper and I realised something.

I realised that I have been actually enjoying the journey. The destination if at all got me excited, it was only for the distance from my start point (as they say, "*the more the merrier!!!*"). Apart from the distance nothing about the destination excited me. I realised that the place where my journey ended isn't actually a point where there were no roads further and I can actually proceed for as long as I feel like, couldn't I? and even without essentially taking a return, I would still come back to the point where I started, wouldn't I? (it would just be the matter of time though) The **Earth isn't flat, afterall**! A **Destination** is just a point of reference in a trip from where one have to take a 'TURN' which could even be a re'TURN'. Doesn't that mean, that every end is just a new beginning?

<!-- Now, I'm equally excited about my destinations just like the journeys. I can take a new turn -->
