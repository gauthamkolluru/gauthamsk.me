In my 6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> grade (if I remember correctly), during a history lecture (as it should be), we officially came across the concept of Caste System in India. It said that it comprises of 4 different types, namely:

1. Brahmins
2. Kshatriyas
3. Vaishyas and
4. Shudras

We were, I'm not quiet sure of what to call it, taught or told, of their definitions as well but I still remember that I scored around as high as 60 for 100 in History (Pun intented) for a reason. I had to lose those 40 marks somewhere, ain't it? :-P. In fact, I'm actually grateful to my brain for helping me score at least that.

Fast forward to the year 2005, months around April - May, post the results of JEE exam. I remember I didn't even check my result, my college principal did and let me know that I didn't make it through and lost in about a mark. Then I heard from somewhere that a friend of mine, belonging to those one of the caste based **Reserved** category had made it through, scoring around half of me. Being angry, not sure for my failure or his success, I confessed that thought to my (another) friend.

Since years and generations together, the so called upper caste people haven't even let others try their performance at education. It is to provide opportunity for them as well this was introduced. The idea was to have certain number of seats reserved for them. Basing on their performance comparatively (amaong them), they were awarded their seats and that their screening cut-offs were not predecided, explained my friend to me. The first thought that struck me after understanding it was that I should be grateful to him for being my friend for his sensibleness by then itself.

Since then, whenever I come across a topic involving the caste system, I've been pondering on it. Wondering that had there ever been any innovation ever in the 'history' of human kind that was intended to harm the human race? Any innovation made, was to improve our living standards and it was few individuals who have been using the same tools for a completely contradictory purposes. Just like barter system was introduced for making everybody able to enjoy things that they didn't had and then that was introduced into marriages (pun intended!). Then why was this segregation called '**Varna**' was introduced?

***Definition of Varna:***

        <i>
            a Sanskrit word with several meanings including type, order, colour or class, was used to refer to social classes in Brahminical texts like the Manusmriti.

In a nut shell, it means that they are just different shades of the same thing (maybe also of Grey :-P), subtly implying that at the end of the day they all belong to the same thing.

In 2003 when India made it to the finals of the World Cup in Cricket under the official captaincy of [Saurav Ganguly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourav_Ganguly), it was told that his secret of being able to do so was delegating his powers of captaincy to his peers like, [Mohammad Kaif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Kaif) and [Yuvraj Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuvraj_Singh) were made the captains of fielding, [Sachin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar) and himself have been the captains decising the batting order and so with the bowlers. Now, Why do you think he has implemented this strategy of segregation if not to produce better output? Does that mean that Batsmen are more important than bowlers or bowlers are more important than the fielders or anything combination of them? At the end of the day, isn't it the team that made it?

I also what is the most important part of a vehicle? Can you imagine what could happen, if the nut that's holding the wheel of your machine with body gives up? At least, what if the tyre itself gives up while you're riding pretty excitedly? Have you ever observed a professional mechanic of any machine, keeps all his nuts, bolts and all parts of the machine keeps them propely segregated? Why do you think he does so?

Similarly, people who were acquiring knowledge by research and sharing thier knowledge were segregated and were named as Brahmins. Those who were guarding and administering the welfare of all others were named as Kshatriyas, those who performed trading were termed as Vaishyas including the agriculturists and farmers and the ones who offered their services were termed as Shudras. Now, who is more important than the other? Isn't this subtly implying that we are all interdependant? Then when dependency is mutual, how come one is at a higher place in the society to the other?

But I guess the problem must have actually arrived when the descendants of the above segregated groups came into picture and they must have concluded that it is logically obvious to make the descendant of a Brahmin to become a Brahmin, after all, genes would come into the play, right? While their presumption holds good in general but there are other factors as well in the development of mind, ain't it? If not, then how come (in recent times), Anand Kumar, a dalit, was able to make it to Cambridge? And, how come the descendant of the head of the first family of Bollywood struggled at the industry?

While genes do have their influence, making Anand Kumar fall apart prior to starting his own Gurukul (that stands true to it's definition) and Abhishek Bachchan in having exceptional acting abilities (don't agree with me? watch Yuva & Raavan), that's not all that's involved in shaping an individual.

I see this caste or Varna as an ID card. It is just your identity at work. It is created just to make sure that the right source is identified for the right job. Apart from which it is not you.

Couple of years ago, I stumbled upon this thought that every individual has all the four varnas within themselves. His mind is his Brahmin, he protects himself with his arms at which he is a Kshatriya, at trading his time for resources for living, he is a Vaishya and the part of his body that makes him do all the above and more, his feet, at which he is a Shudra. And today I learnt that, the Rig Veda, one of the four vedas, has a piece of text that acknowledges the above under the title ['***Purusha Sukta***'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_(Hinduism))

Conclusively, any segregation was made to improve the efficiency of our living itself not to call ourselves superior to others or feel inferior to others. If even in these times one wants to label, then label [Mr. Anand Kumar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand_Kumar), leading trainer of AI, [Mr. Andrew NG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) and all the professors, lecturers and teachers and preachers as Brahmins. The defence system of all the countries as Kshatriyas. The product based companies as Vaishyas and the service based companies as Shudras. After all, that was what the original definition meant. Isn't so?
