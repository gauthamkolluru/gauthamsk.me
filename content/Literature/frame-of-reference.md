<!-- The following information is just a perspective or a school of thought that I've been having since quiet sometime now and I just want to share -->

Many a time, I've wondered if physics is just a branch of science explaining matter, energy and the interaction between them or that it also explains the way of life in it's own subtle way..?

Every morning, before going to work, I'm used to stop at a coffeeshop near my place for a hot cup of filter coffee and today was no different, but this time,  I believe that the shopkeeper has felt that he should give something extra to me for my loyalty of visiting his shop every morning for coffee (since about last 3 months) and so he added a decently thick layer of fat that comes from heating milk, which as a matter of fact, I hate. I had thought of yelling at him that "Your's is the only shop I have on my way to work, I just don't have an option and you don't have to start being loyal to me" but preferred to let him know about it only if it repeats. So, for now to be able to enjoy my coffee as usual, I managed to make that layer get stuck to one side of the mouth of the cup for being able to have a fat (layer) free coffee from the other side of the mouth (of course, of the cup).

After having a couple of sips of a drink from one side of the cup and changing the side for the next sip feels quiet different(at least for me) as if I'm having the different drink from a different cup, as if that side of it is unknown to me. But after a couple of sips from that new side, it again feels just the same but that's not the case with the very first sip. As usual, I wondered why?

(I sometimes also wonder that why do I wonder so much?)

I then realised that it doesn't feel so for the first sip because, for the first sip, both the cup's and my lips will be unacquainted but wanting to know each other but after a sip only the other side of the mouth of the cup will be dry and my lips wet, having potential difference in the state of being.

The dry side of the cup offers some (unexpected) friction on our lips that wasn't being offered as much in the first sip itself, let alone of the fact that both, our lips and that edge of the cup were getting lubricated with the first sip we had there by reducing the friction further.

This thought has started flashing a couple of images in front of my eyes like, a person walking on the road suddenly loses control and skids, a person skiing in the snow mountains suddenly making the direction of his ski board exactly perpendicular to the direction of his skiing to come to attain the state of rest, an ice skater doing quiet similar thing in a skating rink just to change his direction of travel, a person flying down to land with a parachute and a recent discussion that I had with a friend about polarities of thoughts.

All these images and bits of videos flashed in for just a couple of moments, paving way to this couple of minutes to read article.

People are able to not just walk but perform a lot of physical activties day-in and day-out due to the existence of these opposing forces called friction. Just imagine, had there been no friction, nothing would have been as simple as it is now. We would've been drifting even while asleep, let alone us trying to move. The vision of a person walking, suddenly losing control for a brief period of time happened as the ground he's walking on was wet and his shoe sole also wore off thereby reducing friction enough just to lose control, skid and fall. Some might argue that we would have adapted ourselves to living in such situations itself and here comes the skiers and ice-skaters. Those activities are even possible because of reduced friction. Its just that it is far easier to drift or to skid on such grounds than to stand at one position. Skiers have to rapidly change the direction of the ski boards (I'm not exactly sure of what they are called) to about 90 degrees away from the direction of their travel to come to rest and this is because the frictional force is directly proportional to the surface area it is acting upon and in the direction opposite to that of the direction of the force acting on it. I then wondered can this concept of physics be applied to understand why acts like waking up early or preferring fit to fat offers more friction but helps in having control on oneself but the acts like, eating junk food and sleeping late offers less friction but support losing control more.

Now this above extended application of one concept triggered another one, Sir Issac Newton's first law of motion, "A body continues to be in the state of rest or uniform motion along a line unless and until it is compelled by an external force". I wonder if this is why, one requires a lot of external force for doing / preventing from doing certain things regularly like, a person procrastinating continually requires the external force of a submission or an examination date to actually work on it.

Also, there is a principle that we've learnt of, during our schooling, that "If a process of transformation from A to B takes more effort then the process of transformation from B to A takes very less effort" and this made me think if this is the reason why, it is comparatively easier to do drugs than to quitting it and so to get fat than to stay fit? but it doesn't end here.

The other day, one of my friends asked me if I was wondering why is he so pessimistic? I replied him with this exact same thing as follows, "One of my childhood friends once said that 'Had we not been optimistic about flying, Aeroplanes wouldn't have been invented and had we not been pessimistic about it crashing, Parachutes wouldn't have been invented, So, I think both are just different schools of thought and are required but just in the right quantities". I started pondering upon it, wondering what does it mean by 'right quantities'?

In sanskrit, there's a saying that goes like ***"Ati sarvatra varjayeth!"***, meaning, *excess of anything should be avoided* or in other words even an excess of good is also bad.

(Now, this made me wonder about...)

Have you ever wondered what proverbs are? or How or where did they come from?

Well, I did and realised that proverbs mostly are the experiences of individuals that were quoted in the simplest way possible, mostly by using analogies or metaphors and are called as Idioms as well for their grammatical structure.

While trying to pursue the meaning of 'right quantities', I stumbled upon the aspect of existence of opposites without actually existing.

(Bewildered? Worry not...)

One day another friend of mine asked me to define time. I tried to start answering and realised not a word I had. I took time to think about it, how ironical?. I took two days and I realised and accepted that I was 18 (then) and do not even understand what time is? I met my friend and confessed. He explained it in just 5 words "Measure of Interval between Events". I started pondering upon his explanation and then is when I understood the concept of **frame of reference** and that, the Time that we're measuring globally is just one such reference, else how come Australia, Japan and USA are so close to each other by geographical distances and yet about a day apart by time. Almost all fundamental concepts are the resultants of such frames of reference. The directions that we have, starting with East, it is defined as the direction in which the Sun Rises and not the other way around, the direction opposite to that of the East is named as 'West', the direction to the left of East is termed as North and the remaining is South. But, how to determine the exact 'left' of East or about anything?

I wonder, when the people who defined these conventions were defining the conventions, if something like the follows had happened,

    People defining conventions: "Which side of the body you all most use?"

    Mob: Lifted their most used side's convenient part of the body, the hand.

    People defining conventions: "Right!" (That just meant assertion, until then though...)

    Mob: Shouting with happiness "Right, Right, Right!!!"

    People defining conventions: "And now, what is left ?" (They must have actually meant, what was remaining... (pun intended))

    Mob: Shouting with overjoy "Left, Left, Left!!!", lifting the other one of the two hands

    People defining conventions: "What the fff...Frame of Reference!!!"

and then we have our "Right and Left" with more than one meaning attached to each which can be deciphered according to the context they are used in, which again is just another frame of reference. This concept of "frame of reference" came into the picture while figuring out the concept of "Right Quantities", which means to find the quantities with reference to the situation / requirement. Just like, hundreds of thousands of volts of electricity is required to be produced at the power plants to be able to power the our houses at 220V / 110V. Just like, 220V voltage required for your refrigerator but only 10V is required by your mobile phone.

I then realised that ideas like large and small are understood only with reference to something and do not carry a definition of their own. So does other similar ideas like positive & negative, right & wrong, good & bad / evil. They are just the results of some frame of references.

After all, What is electricity, if not transfer of electrons (negatively charged bodies) from one place (excess) to another place (lacking, positively charged body) just to maintain potential balance.

But, how does negativity in us humans help us?

My uncle said (couple of months prior to learning the definition of time), "It's definitely good to have fear for exams but only as much that it makes to attempt it properly, not more not less". Long after that, considering fear as a negative emotion, I felt that one also should be harsh to oneself just as much required to push ones boundaries by the day and criticise oneself just to improve up on but not a meaningless abasing / abusing of oneself.

After all, had there been no friction being offered by copper wire, would there be a fuse?

Summing up, just like, going to the gym or waking up early every in the morning offers decent friction but when overcomed makes us have more control over our own lives and the other side of the activites like doing drugs offer pretty less friction, making you drift faster away, losing control. Knowingly or unknowingly we've all been overcoming friction day-to-day in our lives, at least in our physical activities if not at anything else and just like we buy our footwear, looking the ones with more grip, we have to find activities to get more grip over our own lives and live every moment being entirely aware, making every choice and every decision willfully.

As once my uncle said,

Every morning, after having a hot cup of coffee, I head to work directly but today is a different day. Today, I head back to my place where I live, to write an article for my blog and leaving for work now.

<!-- I have learnt sometime ago that I have somehow picked up this habbit of trying figure out the meanings of concepts and terms / words from my experiences itself or from the context of their usage, respectively. -->
