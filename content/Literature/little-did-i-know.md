I told her, “look, I told you ‘I love you’, it is a feeling that I feel for you, it wasn’t a proposal, more like a confession (little did I know how it would turn up then) if you too feel the same then you should acknowledge by saying the same and not that ‘I’m ok with what you said’”. Yeah, I was that pathetic talking to my girlfriend back then or was I? 😉

Sorry sorry, It would have went over your heads but definitely out of context and both at once. My bad or was it???

Okay, so, here is how it all started... Who cares by the way, unless it is told in a way that keeps us engaged... in short, spiced up! 😜

It was during my first out-station techfest<sup>1</sup>, in Chennai. It was about a 5-6 day trip with about 30 of my friends from my department of my college. I had this some kind of strange feeling the first time I saw her... No, she wasn’t all too fair in complexion, No, she wasn’t wearing a white or red or yellow dress with a pink or maroon or black dupatta (respectively 🤪) and No again, her dupatta wasn’t flying over my face nor she did she leave her hair loose that set odour in the air that I was supposed to breathe. As far as I remember she hadn’t even washed her hair that day. Its now that you should think either ‘love is blind’ or ‘buy yourself a mirror, bro!’ but only my fellow passengers of the single’s ship would say “yeah, temme about it...” (feeling they know everything, which is although almost true) and as a matter of fact, such delusions stopped showing up even in the Indian cinemas when the bvoy Mr. Chetan Bhagat incepted. I wonder if the filmmakers dropped the idea by feeling threatened or pissed? 😜

Anyways, after about 2 months since I met her we went to that Chennai trip I mentioned earlier. The first 2-3 days we were participating in various events and cared excreta about anything else but 2 days before the last, My girlfriend and myself had a presentation to deliver. The best part was not that the presentation was not ready but wasn’t even started and we haven’t even effin had a laptop. I just started my 2nd yr of UG then and yeah, engineers in India do not even have them after decades of graduation (exaggerated a bit). By the way, forgot to mention, my college also sent a professor with us to look upon us at all times. Little did we bother about him, you see. So, the day before our presentation, I took permission from my prof (as I had to or he thought so...) to go to an internet cafe with my teammate (not my girlfriend already, then).

We came out of the campus looking for a ride and found one. That was the time the when people could make out that we were not locals and know nothing about nothing without even a single glance at us. That naive we were... or at least looked! The auto-rikshaw guy decided to drop us at the cafe for 100 bucks. I was not sure if I had bargained it well. Soon I realised though, when he took a U-turn and dropped us right opposite side of the street where we boarded the ride.

My friends already started gossiping about us and I didn’t bother much as I know that gossiping started when the third person evolved on the planet. In the internet cafe, we both took different terminals dividing work. I was fighting with myself to not look at her and concentrate at the task at hand. After about a couple of hours, I do not remember how many, the presentation was finally made and took a good shape or at least we thought.

Then came the D day. We felt a sudden surge of tension. Our presentation was scheduled for 2pm, having no breakfast or lunch until then we gave our presentation. It went really well, we learnt a lot or should we say we were royally raped (only figuratively) on the dias? The panel had started explaining certain concepts conveying our thoughts were absurd, the didn’t just say the word, I guess (not a bad thing though, I effin still remember it, what that they have explained). Coming out of the hall I completed my part of regretting, I mean crying briefly in about 10-15 seconds for that wonderful fiasco (It wasn't a full heartful cry, just to make sure my prof and friends noticed as I know that wasn't my engineering stream and that I was actually happy for learning something) and then she fainted, my vision was blurred at not being able to comprehend the situation. Not such an un-comprehend-able situation though, I just got it exaggerated it in my mind. Then I realised something, remember that strange feeling that hit me the first time?, hit me again only this time it was harder and I was down like completely, not physically though. I was feeling the pain but I’m sure that wasn’t physical. I was glad when she came back to her senses but the pain in me persisted.

Now, have you ever heard anything sh**tier than “that pain actually made me happy”? Yeah, I was the guy saying that. I know this must be sounding more dramatic than the most dramatic movie ever made but yes, I was just 19 and inexperienced then.

However, the last day of that trip we planned a day full for shopping or should I say window shopping? The whole day I just stayed with the group that had her. Not a word I said to her that day. I was very much occupied with stealing glances of her.

Coming back from the trip, we started talking to over phone like all night. And in about a week or so, I let it out, those so called magical words, ‘I love you’. About a month or so later, just before one of our mutual friend’s birthday she said ‘ok’. This is when I lectured her about what was ok?, knowingly (coz, maybe I wanted to here it from her, the so called magical words, little did I foresee the future). The thing I wrote in the first para...

Nothing different happened to what that was already mentioned in any of the good romantic books or movies, until marriage.
