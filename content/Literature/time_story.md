## Prologue

Long long ago, so long ago that only I know how long ago (of course)... the year is... n't important but the __TIME__ is... indeed. It was after losing the entrance into the most prestegious engineering institutions in India at the Graduate Level (__JEE__) and before resorting to a state level college. My friend asked me to _define Time_. I wasn't sure why and tried replying with "it is... " and got paused. A lot of thoughts have begun crossing my mind of the references of the concept that I've been using until then, trying to figure out a simple definition. For the next two days, I was just wondering and finally ended up learning that I, perhaps, do not understand the concept. I confessed the same to my friend and he (with a grin) said... 

_I'll rather save that for the later part of this article, meanwhile, try defining it yourself. _

## Concept & Convention

One day at a college, a professor asks Alice to measure the perimeter of their college compound in _centimeters (cm)_ and soon Alice leaves to find a scale to measure. A while later, noticing that Alice hasn't returned yet, the professor asks Bob, if he can do it any sooner? Bob says "sure" and startles to the main gate of the campus and starts walking along the compound wall counting the number of steps he has been taking and answers the professor with the count of steps he took to cover the perimeter multiplied by a fair estimate of his foot length, long before Alice could do. 

## Understand Concept vs Knowing Convention

The difference between the approaches adopted by Alice and Bob though both hold good is that, Alice just knew the conventions of measuring and so left for finding a scale that is calibrated with some known standards of measurement and Bob understood the _concept of measurement_ and that all he needs to do is to gauge the length of the compound wall along it's stretch against some units. He understands that units could be actually anything, as long as he could convert it to the units of the professor interest. 

In other words, Bob understands that any standards of measurements have become so because a group of people just agreed upon it. That is simply why the volume of a gallon is _4.54 litres_ in Britain and India and _3.79 litres_ in USA. He understands that these standards came into picture only to have a unified understanding to the _yard sticks_ of measurements. 

## Conclusion

Had I not tried to understand one concept (_Time_) then, I feel that I could have easily fallen prey for all these overwhelmingly different concepts that I came across all this while that would have easily tripped me over and quit learning quiet a while ago and therefore tried to showcase the importance of understanding the concepts, for one who understands the subject could adopt any convention that comes his way. 

## Epilogue

... it is _"the gap / duration between any two random events"_ and it got me pondered again for about the next 2 days, just trying to apply the definition for the events that I've come across and deduce the evolution of the concept of _Time_ and its standards.
