## Prologue

Long long ago, so long ago that only I know how long ago (of course)... the year is... n't important but the __TIME__ is... indeed. It was after losing the entrance into the most prestegious engineering institutions in India at the Graduate Level (__JEE__, the one that I've always admired and aspired) and before resorting to a state level college. My friend asked me to _define Time_. I wasn't sure why and tried replying with "it is... " and paused. A lot of thoughts have begun crossing my mind of the references of time that I've used until then trying to figure out a simple definition. For the next two days, I was just wondering and finally ended up learning that I, perhaps, do not understand a concept that I almost used always. I confessed to my friend and he (with a grin in his face) said... 

I'll rather save _that_ for the later part of this article, meanwhile, try defining it yourself.

<!-- The two years before the above exam, let's call it "pre-college", one of my lecturers used to say, "One needs an _interrogative approach_ towards solving the problems precisely in the JEE". I tried to adapt that style of solving problems until then but it always happened explicitly, like I used to force myself to take that approach but when my friend gave his definition of time, I immediately started applying it to real-time scenarios and testing it and that "Interrogative Approach" became more implicit.-->

## Concept & Convention

One day at college, a professor asks Alice to measure the perimeter of their college compound in _centimeters (cm)_ and soon Alice leaves to find a scale to measure. After sometime, noticing that Alice hasn't returned yet, the professor asks Bob, if he can measure any sooner? Bob says "sure" and startles to the main gate of the campus and starts walking along the compound wall counting the number of steps he has been taking and answers the professor with the count of steps he took to cover the perimeter multiplied by a fair estimate of his foot length, long before Alice could find the scale and measure.

## Understand Concept vs Knowing Convention

While both the above methods hold good in solving the given problem, Alice just knew the conventions of measuring and so left for finding a scale that is calibrated with the known standards of measurement where Bob understood the concept of measurement and that all he needs to do is to gauge the length of the compound wall along it's stretch against some units. He knows that units could be literally anything as long as he could convert it to the units the professor asks and therefore, he chose foot length as his units.

The difference between their approaches is just the result of the difference between their perspectives. Alice thought that any measurement must be made in the standards learnt and therefore must require a scale to be able to measure and Bob thought, any standard has become a standard because a group of people agreed so. After all, even those groups must have initially used anything that they had at their disposal to measure. As conveying a new idea to a large groups of people became difficult as one must define the measurement scale used even before the actual idea, they thought making certain units as a standard would make it easier in the future.

## ...in real time

Gradually, people seem to have forgotten that, standards are brought into picture to convey ideas and that ideas are what that are noble. Just like, weapons are tools for self defence and hunting prey, grading system as incepted to have an idea of how much a student has learnt or even better, to identify his area of interests, language is made for communication.

It is the tools, the grades and the language that are given more importance these days compared to feeding and protecting oneself, identifying the interests and communication, respectively.

## Conclusion

Standards / Conventions are important in conveying an idea but what would you do if you don't have an _idea_ itself to convey?

## Epilogue

After testing his definition with the cases that I could think of, I realised that, while I was able to identify time as _something'o clock_ or that I took _so-many_ minutes in doing something, all I understood was meagre _how to read a clock_ and _how to measure change in the clock's readings_. And after a session of pondering on the concept, I then understood, why is it the way it is? Why is it that Indian Standard Time is calculated as Greenwich Mean Time + 0530 Hrs and why is 1 minute is defined as 60 seconds and so on.

This led me to realise that, we're so much caught up in convincing others that we understand things that we ended up learning what makes others think that we understand it.

"I don't have to learn this chapter, it doesn't have much weightage in the exam"... 

"argh! I dont have to understand it, you can just make modifications and send it back, thanks."

are all just the versions of, "It is enough if I'm able to learn this much, more than that, who would ask?"
