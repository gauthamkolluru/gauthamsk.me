Long long ago, so long ago that only I know how long ago (of course)... the year is... n't important but the __TIME__ is... indeed. It was after losing the entrance into the most prestegious engineering institutions in India at the Graduate Level (the one that I've always admired) and before resorting to a state level college. My friend asked me a question, "Define Time". I instantaneously replied with "it is... " and paused. A lot of thoughts were crossing my mind of the references of time that I've used until then but none defined it. For two days, I was just wondering, how to define time and eventually ended up understanding, that I, might, perhaps, do not understand one of the highly used concepts in my day-to-day life. I confessed the same with my friend and he, with a grin in his face said, "it's just the duration between any 2 random events".
