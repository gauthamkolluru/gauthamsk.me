Here are the links to my Github project repositories:

- [Python Labs](https://github.com/gauthamkolluru/PythonLabs) : Here one can find code that I have written in, of course, Python. The type of code varies from [HackerRank problem solutions](https://github.com/gauthamkolluru/PythonLabs/tree/master/HackerRank) to Project Euler problem solutions to [Automation scripts](https://github.com/gauthamkolluru/PythonLabs/tree/master/Automation) that I have written for my computer which is running on linux, yet since the code is written in Python it is pretty much platform independant. Specific links can be found below

- [Automation Scripts](https://github.com/gauthamkolluru/PythonLabs/tree/master/Automation) : Ranging from System automation to Gmail mail automation

- [Hacker Rank Problem Solutions](https://github.com/gauthamkolluru/PythonLabs/tree/master/HackerRank) : Repository for Hacker Rank problem solutions for "Problem Solving" section
